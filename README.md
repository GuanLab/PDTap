## Fine-motor digital biomarkers performs superior for predicting Parkinsonâ€™s disease

### Description

The work is an application of the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Parkinson's disease predictions using the tapping data, and makes the comparisons with other digital biomarkers such as the gait/rest and the voice. The models come from our winning solution of the 2017 PDDB DREAM Challenge. Please contact (gyuanfan@umich.edu) if you have any questions or suggestions.

Install the dependencies through the provided environment file  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```
git clone ...
```

### Input Data
The tapping data are stored in the .json format. Before given to the model, we transfer them to numpy arrays as the following and save to .npy files. Please check the `extract_coord.py` as an example on extracting the coordinates data from the JSON files.
```

### Models
Codes of the experiments are in the `accel/` and `coord/` folders. Note that to ensemble the models from different data or methods, we directly average the predictions and evaluate, instead of training a new model.
```
# To train the accelerometer models, find the bash.sh in the folder, and run
bash bash.sh
# And to evaluate, run
bash evaluation.sh

# To train the coordinate models, find the train.sh in the folder, and run
bash train.sh
# And to evaluate, run
bash evaluate.sh
```
